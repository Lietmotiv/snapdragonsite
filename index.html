					<p><strong>We make paper out of your flowers!  </strong>Flowers are an important part of celebrating and a great deal of time is taken to be sure the right color and types of flowers are selected. After the event many people throw their flowers away. Snapdragon has come up with a beautiful way to preserve your flowers to display with your photo memories. This is a unique keepsake for you, your parents, in-laws, wedding party, grandparents, family, and friends. It is also a great gift idea for a bride or groom!</p>
					<p>We have experimented with flower drying methods, flower pressing methods, paper making ingredients and more. We use only the highest quality products to produce archival quality paper with your flowers. We can use almost any flower to create your memory! Our vision is to share our love for creativity and nature with  you!</p>

                  <p>  What an amazing few weeks! Chris and I can't stop talking about how amazing the wedding was! It was better than we could have even dreamed and we couldn't be more pleased:). It was everything I could have ever wanted and MORE! We wanted to thank you again for all you did to help the day go by smoothly...from figuring out the tie fiasco, to getting the cigars, to getting my veil, to buying milk for my nephew, to making sure everything got home from the Donovan (just to name a few!). We were more than impressed with all of your hard work and I appreciated your calm demeanor on such a crazy day!</p>

					<p>When I started to plan my wedding I didn’t think I would need a wedding planner. I was determined to do it all myself. The deeper I got into the planning the more I started to realize I may not be able to this on my own. I remember meeting with different vendors and being asked questions that I had not even thought about and I couldn’t even think of the answers. I felt like I was sinking and I started to panic. I sat down with my florist and she highly recommended I talk to Jill to see if she could help out with all of my unanswered questions.</p>
					<p>From the minute I met Jill I felt more at ease about my wedding. She brought so many things to my attention that I would not have thought about on my own. She also helped me work through many road blocks that came up during the wedding planning. On my actual wedding day she went over and above for me to make sure everything went smoothly. She handled everything from decorating issues, seating arrangement chaos, conflicting family dynamics, keeping the vendors in line, ect. Thinking back to all the things Jill did on my wedding day, I am scared to think of how that day would have been without her. I spent so much time, energy, and resources on planning that one day. Booking Jill was the key to ensuring that all my efforts were not wasted and my wedding day turned into the day I always dreamt about.</p>
                     <p style="text-align:right;">Thanks<br>
                     Monique and Garrett </p>
                     <p>Hiring Jill was the best thing we could have done in the process of planning our wedding. She was positive, effective, enthusiastic, and easy to work with. We could not have had such an memorable and enjoyable wedding without her. I would highly recommend Jill to anyone planning a wedding. Her creativity and thoughtfulness allowed us to truly relax and enjoy the most beautiful day of our lives.</p>
